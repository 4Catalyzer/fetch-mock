Yeah, I know I shouldn't need to remind you, but _some_ people... :roll_eyes: 

Please include a code sample to illustrate the problem you're having.
 
If you can, try to recreate the problem with a failing test and submit a PR.

If you can't create a failing test, please create a repo with a minimal test case using your
build/test setup, and link to this in the issue
