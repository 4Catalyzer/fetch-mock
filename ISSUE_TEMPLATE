** Note that issues not adhering to these rules, and not responding to requests to

please stick to the rules **

Check the troubleshooting guide and read the API docs before raising an issue
    - http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/troubleshooting
    - http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/api
    
Be clear and precise about what the issue is. Take the time to include details of
what's wrong, including the version of fetch-mock you're using and which environment
it's running in.
- Bad: 'It doesn't work', 'It conflicts with x', 'I get an error'
- Good: 'When using webpack 4 and babel 7 I get an `Error: undefined array at line 191`
  during compilation'

Provide code that recreates the issue you're having. Ideally either
    - recreate the problem with a failing test and submit a PR
    - create a repo with a minimal test case using your build/test setup, and 
      link to this in the issue

Both the above may seem like a lot of work, but the easier you make it for me to 
recreate the bug, the sooner it'll get fixed.
