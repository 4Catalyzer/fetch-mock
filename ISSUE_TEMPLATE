Yeah, I know I shouldn't need to remind you, but _some_ people... :roll_eyes: 

Please include a code sample to illustrate the problem you're having.
 - If you can, try to recreate the problem with a failing test and submit a PR.
 - If you can't create a failing test, please create a repo with a minimal test case using your
build/test setup, and link to this in the issue. 

Both the above may seem like a lot of work, but the majority of issues raised these days tend 
to relate to interoperability problems with other libraries, and a brief code sample in the
issue probably won't be enough to diagnose the problem
