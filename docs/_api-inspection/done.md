description: |-
  Returns a Boolean indicating whether `fetch` was called the expected number of times (or has been called at least once if `repeat` is undefined for the route)
content_markdown: |-
  Unlike the other methods for inspecting calls, unmatched calls are irrelevant. If no `filter` is passed, `done()` returns `true` if every route has been called the number of expected times.
