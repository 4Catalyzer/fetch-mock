title: Configuration
position: 7
description: On either the global or sandboxed `fetchMock` instances, the following config options can be set by setting properties on `fetchMock.config`. Many can also be set on individual calls to `.mock()`
parameters:
  - name: sendAsJson
    content:  [default `true`] - by default fetchMock will convert objects to JSON before sending. This is overrideable from each call but for some scenarios e.g. when dealing with a lot of array buffers, it can be useful to default to `false`
  - name: includeContentLength
    content:  [default `true`]: When set to true this will make fetchMock automatically add the `content-length` header. This is especially useful when combined with `sendAsJson` because then fetchMock does the conversion to JSON for you and knows the resulting length so you donâ€™t have to compute this yourself by basically doing the same conversion to JSON.
  - name: fallbackToNetwork
    content:  [default `false`] If true then unmatched calls will transparently fall through to the network, if false an error will be thrown. If set to `always`, all calls will fall through, effectively disabling fetch-mock. to Within individual tests `.catch()` and `spy()` can be used for fine-grained control of this
  - name: overwriteRoutes
    content: : If a new route clashes with an existing route, setting `true` here will overwrite the clashing route, `false` will add another route to the stack which will be used as a fallback (useful when using the `repeat` option). Adding a clashing route without specifying this option will throw an error.
  - name: warnOnFallback
    content:  [default `true`] If true then any unmatched calls that are caught by a fallback handler (either the network or a custom function set using `catch()`) will emit warnings
  - name: Headers
    content:
  - name: Request
    content:
  - name: Response
    content:
  - name: Promise
    content:
  - name: fetch
    content:
content_markdown: |-
  When using non standard fetch (e.g. a ponyfill, or aversion of `node-fetch` other than the one bundled with `fetch-mock`) or an alternative Promise implementation, this will configure fetch-mock to use your chosen implementations.

  Note that `Object.assign(fetchMock.config, require('fetch-ponyfill')())` will configure fetch-mock to use all of fetch-ponyfill's classes. In most cases, it should only be necessary to set this once before any tests run.
